## Phase 1 Development Focus

### Critical Implementation Decisions Made
Refer to [Technical Decisions](decisions.md) for complete ADR records:

1. **Base Platform**: Bluefin-DX for immutable OS with gaming support
2. **Container Runtime**: Docker CE for ecosystem compatibility

4. **Update Strategy**: User-defined maintenance windows
5. **Stack Management**: Template-based deployment with dependency resolution

### Anticipated Challenges (from decisions.md)
Detailed in [Technical Decisions - Phase 1 Challenges](decisions.md#phase-1-challenges--learnings):

1. **iVentoy Parameter Handling** (High Risk) - Critical for UX
2. **First-Boot Service Orchestration** (High Risk) - Core automation
3. **BlueBuild Recipe Complexity** (Medium Risk) - Foundation issue
4. **Update Scheduling Complexity** (Medium Risk) - User-defined windows
5. **Docker Integration** (Medium Risk) - OSTree considerations
6. **Monitoring Stack Integration** (Medium Risk) - Many moving parts
7. **Directory Structure** (Low Risk) - Standard but important

### Success Metrics for Phase 1

#### Technical Metrics:
- [ ] BlueBuild recipe builds successfully in CI/CD
- [ ] iVentoy boot completes without manual intervention
- [ ] All monitoring services start and remain healthy
- [ ] System survives reboot after first-boot setup
- [ ] Updates execute during scheduled windows

#### User Experience Metrics:
- [ ] Complete beginner can deploy without technical support
- [ ] Setup process takes under 3 hours total
- [ ] Homepage provides clear overview of system status
- [ ] Update process requires no user intervention

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools:
- **BlueBuild CLI**: For recipe development and testing
- **Podman/Docker**: For container testing
- **VS Code**: With recommended extensions for YAML, shell scripting
- **GitHub CLI**: For repository management
- **Test Environment**: VM or spare hardware for testing

5. Begin with minimal BlueBuild recipe

### Priority Development Order:
1. **Create minimal BlueBuild recipe** - get basic building working first
2. **Implement parameter parsing** - foundation for automation
3. **Set up first-boot service** - core automation system
4. **Deploy monitoring stack** - proves concept works
5. **Add update scheduling** - completes Phase 1 requirements

### Testing Requirements:
- Test on clean VM for every change
- Verify iVentoy parameter handling with various inputs
- Test update scheduling with shortened intervals
- Document any deviations from specification

### Communication Protocol:
- Update this handoff document with progress weekly
- Record actual challenges in [decisions.md](decisions.md)
- Log any specification changes or architectural updates
- Prepare detailed Phase 2 handoff upon completion
