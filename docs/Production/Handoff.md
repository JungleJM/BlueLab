### Phase 2: Stack System (PENDING - NOT STARTED)
**Goal**: Implement all predefined stacks and core management systems

**üìù IMPORTANT TRANSITION NOTES**: 

**ISO Compilation**: Once Phase 2 begins, consider **disabling automatic ISO compilation** in GitHub Actions. Phase 2+ will focus on runtime-downloaded stacks and configurations rather than ISO-embedded changes.

**Auto-Download Toggle**: Implement an `BLUELAB_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=false` flag in Phase 2+ development. This allows:
- **Development testing** with manual script updates via VM snapshots
- **Safe iteration** without affecting production deployments  
- **Production readiness** by setting `BLUELAB_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=true` when ready

```bash
# Example implementation in first-boot script:
BLUELAB_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=${BLUELAB_AUTO_DOWNLOAD:-false}  # Default: false for development

if [ "$BLUELAB_AUTO_DOWNLOAD" = "true" ]; then
    log_info "Auto-download enabled - fetching latest Phase 2+ components"
    download_phase2_stacks
else
    log_info "Auto-download disabled - using embedded templates only"
    # TODO: Enable auto-download for production builds
fi
```

**Benefits**: Faster iteration cycles, safe testing, controlled production rollout

**üö® REMEMBER**: Change `BLUELAB_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=true` when creating production builds for end users

## Phase 1 Development Focus

### Critical Implementation Decisions Made
Refer to [Technical Decisions](decisions.md) for complete ADR records:

1. **Base Platform**: Bluefin-DX for immutable OS with gaming support
2. **Container Runtime**: Docker CE for ecosystem compatibility
3. **Configuration Storage**: `/var/lib/bluelab/` for persistence across updates
4. **Update Strategy**: User-defined maintenance windows
5. **Stack Management**: Template-based deployment with dependency resolution

### Anticipated Challenges (from decisions.md)
Detailed in [Technical Decisions - Phase 1 Challenges](decisions.md#phase-1-challenges--learnings):

1. **iVentoy Parameter Handling** (High Risk) - Critical for UX
2. **First-Boot Service Orchestration** (High Risk) - Core automation
3. **BlueBuild Recipe Complexity** (Medium Risk) - Foundation issue
4. **Update Scheduling Complexity** (Medium Risk) - User-defined windows
5. **Docker Integration** (Medium Risk) - OSTree considerations
6. **Monitoring Stack Integration** (Medium Risk) - Many moving parts
7. **Directory Structure** (Low Risk) - Standard but important

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS: ISO COMPILATION COMPLETE

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Working ISO Generated
- **Artifact**: `bluelab-51.iso` available from GitHub Actions
- **Size**: Full ISO with all Phase 1 components included
- **Build Process**: Fully automated via CI/CD pipeline
- **Components**: All files, services, scripts, and dependencies included

### üì¶ **WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE ISO:**
- ‚úÖ **Base System**: Bluefin-DX 41 with all BlueLab customizations
- ‚úÖ **First-Boot Scripts**: Complete automation system (/usr/bin/bluelab-*)
- ‚úÖ **SystemD Service**: bluelab-first-boot.service enabled for auto-execution
- ‚úÖ **Package Dependencies**: jq, yq, git pre-installed via rpm-ostree
- ‚úÖ **Stack Templates**: All 8 predefined stacks (/usr/share/bluelab/templates/)
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Templates**: Docker, Homepage, global environment configs
- ‚úÖ **iVentoy Integration**: Boot template and web form included

### üî¨ **READY FOR VM TESTING - PHASE 1 VALIDATION NEEDED**

**CRITICAL NOTE**: While all components are successfully compiled into the ISO, 
**actual functionality has NOT been verified**. The following need VM testing:

1. **üîç iVentoy Boot Process**
   - Does the ISO boot successfully from iVentoy?
   - Are kernel parameters parsed correctly?
   - Does the web form integration work?

2. **‚öôÔ∏è First-Boot Automation**
   - Does bluelab-first-boot.service execute automatically?
   - Do all automation scripts run without errors?
   - Is the monitoring stack deployed successfully?

3. **üåê Service Accessibility**
   - Is Homepage accessible at expected URLs?
   - Are all monitoring services operational?
   - Do network configurations work as designed?

4. **üîÑ System Integration**
   - Does the system survive reboots?
   - Are all configurations persistent?
   - Do all components work together as designed?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **KNOWN LIMITATIONS NEEDING RESOLUTION:**
- **Timer Issue**: bluelab-updater.timer is masked and needs investigation
- **Runtime Validation**: All functionality is theoretical until VM tested
- **Performance**: Resource usage and timing unknown on real hardware
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling and failure scenarios untested

## üß™ VM Testing Instructions - IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

### **Step 1: Download the ISO**
1. Go to GitHub Actions: https://github.com/JungleJM/BlueLab/actions
2. Click on the latest successful "Build" workflow run (should show green checkmark)
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Download `bluelab-51.iso` (will download as a zip file)
5. Extract the ISO file from the zip

### **Step 2: VM Setup Requirements**
**Recommended VM Configuration:**
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 500GB+ virtual disk
- **Network**: Bridged adapter (so VM gets its own IP on your local network)
- **Boot**: UEFI mode enabled
- **Platform**: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, or Proxmox

### **Step 3: iVentoy VM Testing Process**

**Option A: Test with iVentoy Parameters (Recommended)**
1. Set up iVentoy with web form template (if available)
2. Use these test parameters in the web form:
   ```
   bluelab.username=testuser
   bluelab.password=testpass123
   bluelab.hostname=bluelab-test
   bluelab.timezone=America/New_York
   bluelab.stacks=monitoring
   bluelab.tailscale_key=[OPTIONAL - leave blank for local testing]
   ```

**Option B: Test with Manual ISO Boot (Fallback)**
1. Boot directly from ISO in VM
2. System should detect missing parameters and prompt interactively
3. Use same values as above when prompted

### **Step 4: What to Monitor During Testing**
1. **Boot Process**: Does the ISO boot without errors?
2. **First-Boot Service**: Check if `bluelab-first-boot.service` runs automatically
3. **Parameter Parsing**: Are the provided parameters correctly processed?
4. **Network Setup**: Does hostname resolution work? (`ping bluelab-test.local`)
5. **Service Deployment**: Are Homepage (port 3000) and Dockge (port 5001) accessible?
6. **Completion**: Does the system show final completion message with service URLs?

### **Step 5: Bug Reporting Strategy for VM Testing**

**For Boot/System Issues:**
- **Screenshots**: Take pictures of VM screen showing any error messages
- **Serial Console**: If VM supports it, enable serial console logging
- **VM Logs**: Check VM software logs (VMware.log, VirtualBox logs)

**For Service Issues:**
- **Network Testing**: Document IP addresses, hostname resolution results
- **Browser Screenshots**: Show what happens when accessing service URLs
- **Service Status**: If you can SSH/access terminal, run `systemctl status bluelab-first-boot.service`

**For First-Boot Script Issues:**
- **Log Location**: `/var/log/bluelab-first-boot.log` contains detailed execution logs
- **Access Method**: 
  - Boot to emergency/rescue mode if system fails
  - Or SSH into system if network works
  - Copy log contents: `cat /var/log/bluelab-first-boot.log`

**Error Log Collection Commands (if system is accessible):**
```bash
# First-boot script log
cat /var/log/bluelab-first-boot.log

# System service status
systemctl status bluelab-first-boot.service
systemctl status docker
systemctl status tailscaled

# Network configuration
ip addr show
systemctl status systemd-resolved
nslookup bluelab-test.local

# Container status
docker ps
docker logs homepage 2>/dev/null || echo "Homepage not running"
docker logs dockge 2>/dev/null || echo "Dockge not running"
```

**Bug Report Format:**
1. **Environment**: VM software, allocated resources, network configuration
2. **Test Method**: iVentoy parameters vs manual boot
3. **Failure Point**: Where exactly did things go wrong?
4. **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of errors
5. **Logs**: Any accessible log files (paste as text or screenshots)
6. **Expected vs Actual**: What should have happened vs what did happen

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools:
- **BlueBuild CLI**: For recipe development and testing
- **Podman/Docker**: For container testing
- **VS Code**: With recommended extensions for YAML, shell scripting
- **GitHub CLI**: For repository management
- **Test Environment**: VM or spare hardware for testing
