üè† Welcome to BlueLab - Your Personal Homelab System

BlueLab transforms your computer into a powerful homelab server with professional-grade 
services that are simple to manage. You're about to configure a system that rivals 
commercial cloud services, but runs entirely under your control.

What you're getting:
‚Ä¢ Homepage Dashboard - Your mission control center  
‚Ä¢ Dockge Container Manager - Professional Docker management
‚Ä¢ Hostname-based access (bluelab.local) - No more remembering IP addresses
‚Ä¢ Remote access via Tailscale - Secure access from anywhere
‚Ä¢ Professional credential management - Enterprise-grade security options

This setup will take 5-10 minutes and will ask you a few simple questions.
Everything can be reconfigured later using 'ujust bluelab-interactive-setup' command.

Let's build your personal cloud infrastructure!
